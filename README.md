# MATLAB-App
 "Developing a MATLAB App for audio signal processing. Features include file handling, time/frequency domain visualization, amplification, equalization, and filtering. Enhance your audio experience effortlessly."
Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive MATLAB App using the App Designer for audio signal processing. The app provides a user-friendly interface for analyzing and manipulating audio signals beyond the sounds of music, with features including file handling, visualization of time and frequency domains, amplification, equalization, and filtering.

Key Features
File Handling: Users can choose audio files from their local library or upload custom audio files.
Visualization: The app provides interactive graphs for visualizing audio signals in both time and frequency domains.
Amplification: Real-time amplification controls with playback functionality.
Equalization: Customizable equalizer panel allowing users to adjust frequency bands.
Filtering: Three types of filters (Low Pass, High Pass, and Band Pass) with configurable parameters.
Project Structure
Step 1: File Handling: Users can choose or upload audio files.
Step 2: Visualization: Display time and frequency domain graphs with options to switch between them.
Step 3: Amplify Page: Real-time amplification controls and playback functionality.
Step 4: Equalizer Page: Customizable equalizer panel for frequency band adjustments.
Step 5: Filtering Page: Options for applying Low Pass, High Pass, and Band Pass filters.
